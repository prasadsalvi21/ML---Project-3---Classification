The objective of this project is to classify the images of handwritten digits according to the
numeric value of the image. Images represent 10 numbers ranging from 0 to 9. These images
are present in two data sets MNIST and USPS. In this project, classification is done using 3
approaches
1. Logistic Regression
2. Single Layer Neural Network
3. Convolutional Neural Network
